# Tic Tac Toe AI Game

## Overview
This is a Python-based Tic Tac Toe game that includes an AI opponent powered by the Minimax algorithm. The game offers an interactive graphical user interface (GUI) built using Pygame, allowing users to play in either player-vs-player or player-vs-AI modes. The AI adapts its strategy based on the selected difficulty level, making it a challenging and enjoyable experience.
